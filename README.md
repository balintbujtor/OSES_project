# OSES_project
This is the project for the Operating Systems for Embedded Systems course at Politecnico di Torino in the academic year 2022/2023.

We implemented a lightweight secure boot process which is based on performance counters.

On the empty_project branch you can find a startup project for the lab experience.
While the development branch includes a proposed solution by us.
