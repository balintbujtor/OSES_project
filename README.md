# OSES_project
“This material was originally developed as part of an assignment of the Operating Systems for Embedded Systems course delivered at Politecnico di Torino by Prof. Stefano Di Carlo”.

We implemented a lightweight secure boot process which is based on performance counters.

On the empty_project branch you can find a startup project for the lab experience, while the development branch includes a proposed solution by us.
